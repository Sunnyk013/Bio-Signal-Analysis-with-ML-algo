Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking

Problem Statement:-
You are working as a data scientist in a globalcompany. Over the years, the company has collected details and gathered a lot of information about individuals. The management wants to build an intelligent system from the data to determine the presence or absence of smoking in a person through bio-signals. Given a person’s information, build a machine learning model that can classify the presence or absence of smoking.

Agenda:-
01 Importing the Libraries
02 Loading the Data
03 Data Cleaning
04 One Hot Encoding
05 Feature Selection 
06 Bagging Algorithms
